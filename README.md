# Made in Heaven - Meta-Mod
A collection of hot fixes and small tweaks of other mods I regularly use.

## Introduction
This is mainly something I put together for my own convenience.  Meta-Mod patches files installed by other mods to fix known bugs and resolve known inter-mod conflicts.  It also contains a component that cleans up file clutter left by unpackaging mods, such as setup-xxx.exe files on a non-Windows system.

This mod will never see an official release as other mods are in constant flux.  Use this at your own risk.  Suggestions for additional fixes are welcome, as are reports that known bugs or incompatibilities have been resolved by the mod maintainers.
