# Made in Heaven - Meta-Mod
A collection of hot fixes and small tweaks of other mods I regularly use.

## Introduction
This is mainly something I put together for my own convenience.  Meta-Mod edits other mods, such as installing hotfixes for bugs until a new version is available, or editing unbalanced items and spells.  A few convenience routines are also included.

The fixes come in two forms: Static and running.
- Static fixes edit the other mod's file before they gets installed, editing or replacing some of them as needed.  This does not affect a game already in progress.  They can be applied only once and cannot be backed out once installed.
- Running fixes edit mod resources after a mod has already been installed.  This is useful if you don't want to reinstall the affected mod or if you want to test the fix first.  They can be uninstalled like a normal mod, but may be less complete than the static fixes; not everything can be fixed in a running game.


## Version History
Version 1 - June 20 2021
- Initial version with static- and running fixes for Sword Coast Stratagems 33.7 (fixes Mind Blank, BG2EE 2.6 compatibility) and Tweaks Anthology (fixes "Lightning bolts don't bounce" on EE 2.6 games).
